# Zava AI: The Decentralized Proactive Intelligence Layer

**Unleash Your Web3 Potential: Proactive AI, Decentralized Power.**

Zava AI is a pioneering decentralized proactive intelligence layer empowering Web3 users with an autonomous AI agent to optimize DeFi assets, manage NFT portfolios, participate in DAO governance, and enhance digital security. Built on principles of transparency, privacy, and true decentralization.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Proactive DeFi Optimization:** Automated yield farming, liquidation protection, and intelligent rebalancing across various protocols.
- **Intelligent NFT Management:** Real-time trend prediction, value analysis, opportunity notifications, and portfolio optimization.
- **Autonomous DAO Participation:** AI-summarized proposals, intelligent voting recommendations, and smart voting delegation based on user preferences.
- **Web3 Security Guardian:** Proactive monitoring for suspicious transactions, real-time alerts, and automated approval revocation for enhanced asset safety.
- **Verifiable AI Computations:** Leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for trustless, on-chain verification of off-chain AI computations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (High-level)

Zava AI operates on a robust architecture designed for decentralization, efficiency, and security:

- **Decentralized AI Network:** AI models and inference are distributed across a network of incentivized nodes, ensuring censorship resistance and scalability.
- **Smart Contracts:** Core on-chain logic written in Solidity manages user authorizations, agent coordination, and critical interactions with underlying Web3 protocols.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Computations performed by the AI agents off-chain are accompanied by ZKPs, allowing anyone to verify the integrity and correctness of the AI's output without revealing underlying data.
- **Cross-Chain Capability:** Designed for seamless interaction across multiple leading blockchain networks, maximizing opportunities and utility.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Local Development)

To get Zava AI up and running on your local machine:

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- Yarn or npm
- Git
- Hardhat or Foundry (for smart contract development and testing)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Zava-AI.git](https://github.com/your
-username/Zava-AI.git)
cd Zava-AI

# 2. Install root dependencies (if using a monorepo setup)
yarn install # or npm install

# 3. Build & Test Smart Contracts
cd contracts
yarn install # or npm install (if contracts have separate package.json)
yarn compile # or npx hardhat compile / forge build
yarn test # or npx hardhat test / forge test
cd ..

# 4. Run the DApp locally
cd dapp
yarn install # or npm install
yarn dev # or npm run dev
```

The DApp should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or similar).
