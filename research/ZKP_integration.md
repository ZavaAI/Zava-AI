# Zava AI: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) Integration

## 1. Overview of ZKP in Zava AI

Zava AI leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to ensure the verifiable integrity of off-chain AI computations. This allows our decentralized AI agents to perform complex inferences efficiently without exposing sensitive user data or AI model parameters, while still enabling anyone to cryptographically verify that the computation was performed correctly.

## 2. ZKP Workflow

1. **Off-chain Computation:** An AI agent (or a decentralized network of compute nodes) performs an AI inference (e.g., portfolio optimization, risk assessment) using off-chain data.
2. **Proof Generation:** After computation, a ZKP (e.g., using zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs) is generated that mathematically proves the computation was executed correctly according to a predefined program (the AI model).
3. **On-chain Verification:** This ZKP is then submitted to a Solidity verifier contract on the blockchain.
4. **Action Authorization:** If the ZKP is successfully verified on-chain, the verifier contract emits an event or updates a state, allowing the Zava AI Agent Core contract to authorize the proposed action (e.g., execute a DeFi trade, adjust an NFT listing).

## 3. Benefits

- **Trustlessness:** Users don't need to trust the AI agent directly; they can verify its computations.
- **Privacy:** Sensitive input data for AI models remains private.
- **Scalability:** Complex AI inferences can be done off-chain, reducing gas costs and increasing throughput.
- **Transparency:** All verified proofs and authorized actions are transparent on the blockchain.
